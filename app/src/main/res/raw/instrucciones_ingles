To start you will have to press the button "Start".
The last image will change and will be the beginning of your sequence;
after clicking on the square that corresponds to that image another image will appear that adds itself to the sequence.
You will have to click the squares in the correct order and everytime you complete it, it will become bigger.
The game ends when you fail to corrctly guess the pattern.
(If the image doesn´t it´s because the image and the previous one are the same.
